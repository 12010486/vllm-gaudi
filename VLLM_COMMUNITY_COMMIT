# vllm-gaudi compatibility pinning:
#   The vllm-gaudi plugin is installed on top of the vllm upstream checkout used by this CI job.
#   When upstream vllm changes its API, the plugin may break before it has been updated.
#   To handle this, the vllm-gaudi repository maintains a file:
#     vllm/last-good-commit-for-vllm-gaudi/VLLM_COMMUNITY_COMMIT
#   The first line of that file controls what version of vllm is used inside the Docker image:
#     - "latest"        : no checkout override; the current Buildkite CI commit is used as-is.
#     - "<commit SHA>"  : vllm is checked out to that specific commit before building, pinning
#                         the test to a known-compatible baseline.
#   To unpin (resume testing against the live vllm tip), set the file content back to "latest".
